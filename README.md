# redis-url-shortener
A simple URL shortener implemented in Python using Redis. Supports insertion, query, and usage statistics tracking.

The application supports:
- Insertion of long URLs (with automatic short code generation)
- Querying short URLs to retrieve the original
- Tracking usage statistics (per-user insertions & average views)

## Setup

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
This will start:

- Python application container (for running the app)

## Run the app

```bash
docker exec -it uom-redis-url-shortener-app bash

Youâ€™ll be asked for a username, then you can perform actions via the menu.
